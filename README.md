# Hi! I'm Daric. If by chance you've found this repo, my privacy settings must not be set right. I'd appreciate you letting me know.
# I'm just here to learn Python for a college course. I kind of like using it, so maybe I'll do something more substantial with this someday.
# For now, it's just for syncing college projects between PCs.
